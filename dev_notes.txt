=======
UX/A11y
=======
visible focus and hover for buttons, links, tabs
manage focus between dialogues
manage /hexagrams/ and /trigrams/ 'stateful' links with aria roles, (e.g. gridcell uses aria-selected)
manage foreground/background opacity levels with dialog boxes
Add title attributes to all buttons that close modal/dialogues
utilize another html attribute besides aria-hidden to toggle display of nav menus
ensure links in modal dialogues have negative tab index until modal is shown


==
UI
==
add more informative text to /trigrams/ modal
utilize status elements to display the selection state of /hexagrams/ grid
deactivate the on-select opening of /hexagrams/ dialog, add separate button
add a clear/reset button to /, experiment with social media share button and OG metadata

=====
Theme
=====
re-implement fade-in effect for Modal::show
fix alignment of modal dialogues
fix alignment of hexagram titles in / and /build

=====
Logic
=====
re-implement URL queries for all routes, /#/1/2/, /build/#/1/2 and hexagrams/#/1/2
  should all set the same Yin => Yang configuration in the UI on page load
for /hexagrams/ menu, dynamically update the hrefs of all grid-cell link-buttons with the first selection, e.g.:
  when grid-cell 1 is the first cell selected,
      all other cell hrefs should update from #/{cell_number} to to /#/1/{cell_number}
      grid-cell 1 href should update to #
  when 2 is the second cell selected, its href should update to /#/1 only
  when the second grid-cell is un-selected and the f
  when the first grid-cell is un-selected and the second-grid cell is still selected
